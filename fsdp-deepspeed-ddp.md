### **Explanations**

1. **FSDP**:
    - **FULL_SHARD**: Splits model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. Provides the highest memory savings but has high communication cost.
    - **SHARD_GRAD_OP**: Splits only gradients and optimizer states. Provides moderate memory savings.
    - **NO_SHARD**: Splits only optimizer states. Provides low memory savings but also low communication cost.

2. **DeepSpeed (ZeRO)**:
    - **ZeRO-1**: Splits only optimizer states. Provides low memory savings.
    - **ZeRO-2**: Splits gradients and optimizer states. Provides moderate memory savings.
    - **ZeRO-3**: Splits model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. Provides the highest memory savings but has high communication cost.

3. **DDP**:
    - No sharding. Each GPU has a full copy of the model. Only gradients are synchronized.
    - Provides low memory savings but also low communication cost.
    - Ideal for small to medium-sized models.

### **When to Use Which?**
- **FSDP**: PyTorch-based workflows, medium to large models, scenarios requiring memory savings.
- **DeepSpeed (ZeRO)**: Very large models, scenarios requiring additional optimizations (CPU offloading, gradient checkpointing).
- **DDP**: Small to medium-sized models, simple distributed training scenarios.
